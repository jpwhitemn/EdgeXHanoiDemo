# Device SNMP Changes

This folder contains files that are added or modified when used with EdgeX's [device-snmp-go](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-snmp-go).
Specifically:
- cmd/res/configuration.toml
- cmd/res/device.snmp.patlite.yaml (added device profile for the SNMP patlite)
- cmd/res/device.snmp.trendnet.TPE082WS.PROFILE (not used, but corrected the example profile to match current EdgeX command structures)
